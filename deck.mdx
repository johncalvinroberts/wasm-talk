# Web Assembly for Dumb People

A tool for running native code on the web.

<Steps>

  By John

</Steps>

<Notes>
  - Very rough web assembly intro: a new thing, a tool for running native code in a browser
  - The scope of this talk - DUMB PEOPLE
</Notes>

# Dumb People?


<Human>This will be a presentation full of gross oversimplifications. The goal is to highlight practical (real world) applications of Web Assembly.</Human>

<Notes>
  - What (in my eyes) is web assembly
  - What is it good for
  - What is it **not** good for
  - Practical, not flashy use cases
  - Architecture and workflow
  - Demo pprmnt  
</Notes>

# 00. What the heck is a WASM?
<Crumb> 00. What the heck is a WASM?</Crumb>

<Steps>

  - WASM = Web Assembly
  - "A tool for running native code on the web" -- What does that mean?
  - How do browsers work? 
  - What is native code?
  - Bundle native code and run it in the browser
  - WASM runs alongside javascript, not instead of or within it.
  - Really, it's a compile target.

</Steps>

<Notes>
  - How do browsers work? The runtime language of the browser is Javascript
  - Native code means basically assembly
  -  What we actually want to focus on is WASM as a compile target for C++, C, Rust, etc.
  - Low-level systems languages that utilize native features, memory management, blah blah. too complicated
</Notes>

<Crumb> 00. What the heck is a WASM?</Crumb>
<Human>In other words, to me it is a <strong>tool</strong>. <br/>
Iit's not a language, a runtime, nor an API. It's a tool that lets me run native code on the web.</Human>

# 01. What are the benefits of using WASM?
<Crumb> 01. What are the benefits of using WASM?</Crumb>

Why would I want to run native code in a browser?

<Steps>

  - Performance
  - Use native code
  - Security - immutable, not observable at runtime.
  - Combining the above 3 points with specific, sharp use cases.
  - Reminder: **completely client side in the browser**.  

</Steps>

<Notes>
  - Performance -- it is faster than javascript, by a lot. I don't understand why exactly but it just is.
  - Use native code - you can use other people's C/C++/Rust code. Great, less code.
  - Security - compiled code is immutable and not observable at runtime, WebAssembly programs are protected from control flow hijacking attacks.
  - Low-level systems languages that utilize native features, memory management, blah blah. too complicated
  - Reminder: **completely client side in the browser**.  No server. Privacy. Etc.

# 02. What is WASM good for?
<Crumb> 02. What is WASM good for?</Crumb>

<Steps>

  - Javascript is "fast enough".
  - We have to ask: what can we **not** do in a browser/javascript?

</Steps>

<Notes>
  - For the most part, Javascript is "fast enough". We don't often run into serious runtime bottlenecks with Javascript. 
  - To figure this out what is WASM good for, we have to ask: what can we not do in a browser/javascript?
</Notes>

# 02. What is WASM good for?
<Crumb> 02. What is WASM good for?</Crumb>

<Steps>

  - Image & audio manipulation
  - File encoding/decoding
  - Cryptography
  - Heavy, performance-critical computations. (like fibonacci)
  - Memory-safe computation/security
      - compiled code is immutable and not observable at runtime, WebAssembly programs are protected from control flow hijacking attacks. [link](https://webassembly.org/docs/security/)
  - Reminder: **completely client side in the browser**.  

</Steps>

---

<Crumb>02. What is WASM good for?</Crumb>
<Human>
  There's a sweet spot for WASM â€” memory-intensive, performance-critical tasks, that might need to do native-y stuff. <br/>
  You'll know when you need it.

<Crumb>03. What is WASM not good for?</Crumb>

# 03. What is WASM not good for?

<Steps>

  - Typical browser stuff
  - Rendering DOM nodes
  - Web pages
  - network i/o
  - Making the buttons "pop"ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ

</Steps>

<Notes>

  - Rendering dom nodes â€” the browser is already REALLLYYY good for that.
  - Frameworks that do that with rust/wasm -- they're just calculating layouts and reconciling dom state inside of wasm, seems pointless.
  - You CAN make user interfaces in it, you can make games with it, but that's definitely not for dumb people.
  
  
</Notes>

---

<Crumb>03. What is WASM not good for?</Crumb>

<Human>
  Typical things you would do in a browser or Javascript are not being replaced by WASM.
</Human>

<Notes>

  - It's not necessarily a silver bullet that is going to make your web app 20x faster

# 04. Practical, not flashy case studies

<Steps>

  - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - Image manipulation
  - [Cyph](https://cyph.app/) - Cryptography
  - [wasm-flate](https://github.com/drbh/wasm-flate) - File compression/decompression
  - Figma - Image manipulation X 1000000

# 05. Architecture case study - pprmnt.cc

<Steps>

  - My own small sharp tool ðŸ¥°
  - Inspired largely by the aformentioned [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
  - An MP3 encoder in the browser, powered by Web Assembly.

</Steps>

<Notes>

  - On topic of small sharp tools, and web assembly, I did find myself in a situation where "you know when you need it".
  - Inspired by Squoosh in its architecture -- a small React app, utilizing classic codecs to encode files.
  - Yes, there are tons of MP3 converters out there in the world, but they are sketchy.
  - I am often dealing with lossless audio, and want to create lightweight lossy version without having to upload to sketchy third party servers.

### Tooling

<Steps>

  - [`libmp3lame`](https://lame.sourceforge.io/) a classic C library for encoding audio to MP3
  - [`emscripten`](https://emscripten.org/) is used to compile `libmp3lame` and C code to Web Assembly.
  - `Docker` - All the emscripten web assembly compilation is done in docker for better portability.
  - Frontend offloads the web assembly operations to [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker) for better performance.

## Key takeaways

<Steps>

 - Actually was pretty easy, dumb person can figure it out
 - Something I originally thought had to be done on backend could actually be done entirely in the browser
 - Only required about 90 lines of C code
 - Majority of the time was spent piping it all together -- workflow, build, architecture, non-blocking workers, etc.
 - Reading the `libmp3lame` library source was pretty interesting
