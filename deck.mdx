# Dumb People?


<Human>This will be a presentation full of gross oversimplifications, overstupidifications, yet serves as a usable, digestable intro to Web Assembly.</Human>

<Notes>
  - What (in my eyes) is web assembly
  - What is it good for
  - What is it **not** good for
  - Practical, not flashy use cases
  - Architecture and workflow
  - Demo pprmnt
